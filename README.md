## Brief Description
This project was developed in three stages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript as seen in the requirements above.   

On a weekly basis, we had to report three things:
* what we completed last week
* what we were planning to complete for following week
* any road blocks that needed attention

The main objective was to create a three-page website for a fictional restaurant of our creation. The pages included:   
* Home
* Menu
* Contact Us

Once completed, this project was submitted for a one-on-one code review with our senior developer.
